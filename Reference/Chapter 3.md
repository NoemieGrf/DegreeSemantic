# Ch3 介词“比“的补足语是短语还是小句



embedded comparative

(1b) John is taller than [opi Gorge believes [ Mary is di-tall]].

subcomparative

(1c) This table is longer than [opi that chair is di-wide].



> An implicit wh  operator is assumed to originate from the adjunct position of “tall” to the specifier of  CP, leaving its trace with a d-type argument, i.e. “opi…di”. 



## 3.1 Puzzles Arise from Clausal Comparatives

<u>**Mandarin: is proved to own clausal comparatives by scholars -> embedded comparatives and  subcomparatives should be legitimate （against the fact）**</u>

(4) *John bi [ opi Gorge xiangxin Mary di-gao] gao. 

(5) *zhe zhang zhuozi bi [ opi na zhang yizi di-kuan]] chang

->hence phrasal comparatives (?)

<u>**Phonemenon: the failures of Mandarin embedded comparartives and subcomparatives**</u>

<u>**Strategy**:</u> 

1. Atrribute to parameters (x)

2. Lin (2009, 2019): 否认了Mandarin clausal comparatives的证据

   - temporal words, prepositional phrases (可以)
   - "V de" (不可以)

3. Liu (1996, 2011): 

   > defines a restriction called “minimal c-commanding”,  stipulating that the complement of “bi” must parallel to the minimal matrix clause containing “biP” in category, semantics and basic syntactic structure. 

   Hsieh (2015,  2017):

   > puts a mechanism by assuming an uninterpretable tense feature on gradable  adjectives. He thinks Mandarin “bi” selects a non-finite clause so that the defective T  head cannot valuate the uninterpretable tense feature on gradable adjectives, which  result in a crash at interfaces. Therefore, gradable adjectives inside “biP” must be  deleted follow the spirit of “rescue by PF deletion (Bošković, 2011). 

   -> "But these two  mechanisms are too stipulative and still fail to cover certain facts"
   
   
   
   ## 3.5 Conclusion
   
   ​	<u>**The primary propose of this chapter is to ==defend clausal analysis of comparatives==  in Mandarin.**</u> 
   
   > Multiple topics comparatives and verbal comparatives are evident  enough to support the clausal status of “biP”.
   
   > As for embedded comparatives and  subcomparatives, they are ruled out on independent ground and never threat the  adequacy of clausal analysis. 
   
   1. For ==**embedded comparatives,**== they are illicit because the addition of verbs like  “xiangxin (believe)”, “renwei (think)”, “tingshuo(hear)”, etc., blocks the derivation of  comparative clauses into a property of degree, i.e.  type in semantics.
   
      > Mandarin  comparative clauses resemble gapless relative clauses in adopting no wh movement  during the process to generate a property of degree or individual.
   
   2.  For ==subcomparatives==, their illicitness has a close relationship with the feature of Mandarin as a topic prominent language. 
   
      > “biP” carries a topic feature but “thanP”  does not.
   
      -> "Mandarin adopts a stricter rule of deletion than English": 
   
      > Rule 1: in English comparative clauses, the deletion of gradable predicates is  optional and it happens under identity at PF. 
      >
      > Rule 2: in Mandarin comparative clauses, the deletion of gradable predicates is  obligatory and it happens under identity at PF
